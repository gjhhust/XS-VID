## Update
- [20240610] Our paper of XS-VID dataset is submitted to arXiv.
- [20240601] The quantitative results of several mainstream methods on XS-VID test-set are reported!
- [20240530] We add the visualization of images in XS-VID.
- [20240528] Our Homepage for XS-VID benchmark opens!


## XS-VID
XS-VID contains a diverse array of scenes featuring multiple categories and sizes of targets. Notably, XS-VID achieves unprecedented breadth and depth in covering and quantifying minuscule targets (< $32^2$ pixels). Some example images are shown below.
